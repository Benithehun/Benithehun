# üí´ About Me:
üëã Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub!<br>I'm a student passionate about coding and exploring the world of software development. My journey started with C and C++, where I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving and low-level programming. Now, I'm diving deeper into Java and SQL, expanding my skillset to include object-oriented programming and database management.<br><br>üîç Curiosity-Driven: I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to learn something new, and I'm always open to experimenting with different ideas and technologies. You could say I'm a problem-solver at heart‚Äîwhether it's debugging code or figuring out how to improve my projects!<br><br>üíª What I'm Learning:<br><br>C/C++: For high-performance applications and understanding the inner workings of systems.<br>Java: My current focus, getting deeper into OOP, algorithms, and building dynamic applications.<br>SQL: Gaining insights into databases and learning how to manage and query data effectively.<br>üéØ Goals:<br><br>Building more projects that bridge the gap between my theoretical knowledge and real-world applications.<br>Collaborating with others to solve interesting problems and contribute to open-source projects.<br>üéâ Fun Fact: I once wrote a program that accidentally ran in an infinite loop, and it took me half a day to figure out why my computer fan wouldn't stop spinning! Lesson learned‚Äîalways check your loops! üòÖ<br><br>Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my repositories or connect with me on this coding journey!
